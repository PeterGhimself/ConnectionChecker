# ConnectionChecker
I was switching internet providers and after setting up the new company set up 
the modem and configuring it I found myself experiencing a very unstable connection 
that would fluctuate ON or OFF, making it very frustrating for any online game play. 
I started to write to a text file (manually) to keep track of when the internet was
changing connection status and the time, and then realized that perhaps I should
try to write a program to do this instead.
