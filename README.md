# ConnectionChecker
I was switching internet providers and after the new company set up their modem and 
configured it, I found myself experiencing a very unstable connection that would 
fluctuate ON/OFF. 
I started to write to a text file (manually) to keep track of when the internet was
changing connection status and the time, and then realized that I could try to write 
a program to do this for me automatically while running in the background.
